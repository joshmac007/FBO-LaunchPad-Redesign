**Objective:** Address inconsistent authorization enforcement and potential for bypass in the FBO LaunchPad backend.

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: PLANNING**

**COMPLEXITY LEVEL:** Level 3 - Intermediate Feature

**SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:** HIGH RISK - Authorization System

## ðŸ“‹ REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

**TASK ANALYSIS:**

**Issue:** The backend has two sets of authorization decorators:
- Older: `src/utils/decorators.py` (`@require_permission`) 
- Newer: `src/utils/enhanced_auth_decorators.py`

**Problem:** Routes may not consistently use the enhanced decorators that leverage the new `PermissionService`, potentially relying on older `user.has_permission()` which might not fully encompass the new granular permission model (direct, group, resource-specific).

**Example Scenario:** An older route using basic `@require_permission('VIEW_ORDERS')` might not correctly evaluate a scenario where a user has `VIEW_ORDERS` only for a *specific* customer through a direct `UserPermission` assignment if the old `user.has_permission` doesn't fully integrate with the new system's nuances.

**Required Actions:**
1. Audit all routes and ensure they use enhanced_auth_decorators where appropriate
2. Systematically deprecate and remove the older require_permission decorator or refactor it to use PermissionService.user_has_permission
3. Implement thorough integration tests for various permission scenarios (direct, group, role, resource-specific)

**COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT: LEVEL 3 - INTERMEDIATE FEATURE**

**Reasoning:**
- Requires systematic audit of existing codebase
- Involves refactoring existing authorization system
- Needs comprehensive testing implementation
- Affects security-critical system components
- Requires careful migration strategy

**STATUS:** Initiating PLAN mode for detailed task planning

**NEXT STEPS:**
- Switch to PLAN mode for comprehensive planning
- Perform detailed code audit
- Create migration strategy
- Design testing framework
- Document security implications
