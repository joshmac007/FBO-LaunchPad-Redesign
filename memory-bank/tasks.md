### **Project Goal: Transition from Multi-Tenant to Single-Tenant Architecture**

**Context:** The system is being refactored to move multi-tenancy from the application layer to the infrastructure layer. Each FBO will have its own dedicated database instance.

**Your Task:** Your goal is to remove all application-level multi-tenancy logic. This primarily involves finding and eliminating every instance of `fbo_location_id` (and its variants like `fbo_id` or `FBOID`) from the codebase. The application code should operate as if it's for a single, global FBO.

### **Phase 1: Backend Database & Model Refactoring**

This phase focuses on updating the database schema. You will modify the data models first, then create database migrations to reflect those changes.

**Step 1.1: Update SQLAlchemy Models**

For each file listed below, remove the `fbo_location_id` column and any associated `UniqueConstraint` that includes it. Replace multi-column constraints with a new constraint on the remaining columns if global uniqueness is required.

*   **File:** `backend/src/models/user.py`
    *   **Action:** In the `User` model, remove the `fbo_location_id` column.
    *   **Before:** `fbo_location_id = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True, index=True)`
    *   **After:** Line removed.

*   **File:** `backend/src/models/fee_rule_override.py`
    *   **Action:** In the `FeeRuleOverride` model:
        1.  Remove the `fbo_location_id` column.
        2.  Update the `__table_args__` to remove `fbo_location_id` from the unique constraint.
    *   **Before:**
        ```python
        fbo_location_id = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False, index=True)
        __table_args__ = (db.UniqueConstraint('fbo_location_id', 'aircraft_type_id', 'fee_rule_id', name='_fbo_aircraft_fee_rule_uc'),)
        ```
    *   **After:**
        ```python
        # fbo_location_id column removed
        __table_args__ = (db.UniqueConstraint('aircraft_type_id', 'fee_rule_id', name='_aircraft_fee_rule_uc'),)
        ```

*   **File:** `backend/src/models/fuel_price.py`
    *   **Action:** In the `FuelPrice` model:
        1.  Remove the `fbo_location_id` column.
        2.  Update the `__table_args__` to remove `fbo_location_id` from the unique constraint.
    *   **Before:**
        ```python
        fbo_location_id = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False, index=True)
        __table_args__ = (
            db.UniqueConstraint('fbo_location_id', 'fuel_type_id', 'effective_date', name='_fbo_fuel_price_uc'),
        )
        ```
    *   **After:**
        ```python
        # fbo_location_id column removed
        __table_args__ = (
            db.UniqueConstraint('fuel_type_id', 'effective_date', name='_fuel_price_uc'),
        )
        ```

*   **File:** `backend/src/models/receipt.py`
    *   **Action:** In the `Receipt` model:
        1.  Remove the `fbo_location_id` column.
        2.  Update the `__table_args__` to remove `fbo_location_id` from the unique constraint. Since a receipt number should be globally unique, the constraint will now only be on `receipt_number`.
    *   **Before:**
        ```python
        fbo_location_id = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False, index=True)
        __table_args__ = (
            db.UniqueConstraint('fbo_location_id', 'receipt_number', name='_fbo_receipt_number_uc'),
        )
        ```
    *   **After:**
        ```python
        # fbo_location_id column removed
        __table_args__ = (
            db.UniqueConstraint('receipt_number', name='_receipt_number_uc'),
        )
        ```

*   **File:** `backend/src/models/waiver_tier.py`
    *   **Action:** In the `WaiverTier` model, remove the `fbo_location_id` column. A unique constraint on `name` should be added if not already present globally.
    *   **Before:** `fbo_location_id = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False, index=True)`
    *   **After:** Line removed. Add `unique=True` to the `name` column: `name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False, unique=True)`.

**Step 1.2: Generate and Implement Database Migrations**

After updating the models, you must create a new database migration file to apply these schema changes to the database.

*   **Action:** Run the Alembic migration generation command from within the `backend` directory.
    ```bash
    flask db migrate -m "Remove fbo_location_id from all models for single-tenant architecture"
    ```
*   **Action:** Inspect the newly generated migration script in `backend/migrations/versions/`. It should contain `op.drop_column()` for each `fbo_location_id` and operations to drop and create unique constraints. Verify its correctness.
*   **Action:** Apply the migration to your local database to ensure it works.
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```

---

### **Phase 2: Backend API & Service Layer Refactoring**

Now, update the backend code that uses the FBO ID. You will remove it from function parameters, API routes, and internal logic.

**Step 2.1: Update Service Layers**

Modify service methods to remove `fbo_location_id` or `fbo_id` parameters and logic.

*   **File:** `backend/src/services/receipt_service.py`
    *   **Action:** Go through each method in `ReceiptService`.
    *   Remove the `fbo_location_id` parameter from the method signatures.
    *   Remove any `.filter_by(fbo_location_id=fbo_location_id)` clauses from all database queries.
    *   **Example (in `create_draft_from_fuel_order`):**
        *   **Before:** `def create_draft_from_fuel_order(self, fuel_order_id: int, fbo_location_id: int, user_id: int) -> Receipt:`
        *   **After:** `def create_draft_from_fuel_order(self, fuel_order_id: int, user_id: int) -> Receipt:`
    *   **Example (in `_get_fuel_price`):**
        *   **Before:** `def _get_fuel_price(self, fbo_id: int, fuel_type: str) -> Decimal:`
        *   **After:** `def _get_fuel_price(self, fuel_type: str) -> Decimal:`

*   **File:** `backend/src/services/admin_fee_config_service.py`
    *   **Action:** Perform the same refactoring as in the previous step for all methods in `AdminFeeConfigService`. Remove `fbo_location_id` and `fbo_id` from signatures and queries.
    *   **Example (in `get_waiver_tiers`):**
        *   **Before:** `def get_waiver_tiers(fbo_location_id: int) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:`
        *   **After:** `def get_waiver_tiers() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:`
    *   **Note:** Some methods like `get_global_fee_schedule` are already correct. Focus on those with FBO-specific parameters.

**Step 2.2: Update API Route Handlers**

Modify the API routes to remove the `/fbo/<int:fbo_id>` path segment and the corresponding function parameter.

*   **File:** `backend/src/routes/receipt_routes.py`
    *   **Action:** For every route in this file, update the path and function signature.
    *   **Example (in `create_draft_receipt`):**
        *   **Before:**
            ```python
            @receipt_bp.route('/api/fbo/<int:fbo_id>/receipts/draft', methods=['POST'])
            def create_draft_receipt(fbo_id):
                ...
                receipt = receipt_service.create_draft_from_fuel_order(
                    fbo_location_id=fbo_id, ...
                )
            ```
        *   **After:**
            ```python
            @receipt_bp.route('/api/receipts/draft', methods=['POST'])
            def create_draft_receipt():
                ...
                receipt = receipt_service.create_draft_from_fuel_order(...) # fbo_location_id removed
            ```
    *   **Action:** Repeat this for all routes in the file.

*   **File:** `backend/src/routes/admin/fee_config_routes.py`
    *   **Action:** Perform the same refactoring for all routes in this file. Remove `/fbo/<int:fbo_id>` from paths and the `fbo_id` parameter from function signatures.
    *   **Note:** Some routes are already global (e.g., `/api/admin/aircraft-classifications`). You only need to change the FBO-scoped ones.

**Step 2.3: Update API Schemas**

Remove `fbo_location_id` from any Marshmallow schemas.

*   **Files:**
    *   `backend/src/schemas/receipt_schemas.py`
    *   `backend/src/schemas/admin_fee_config_schemas.py`
*   **Action:** Search for `fbo_location_id` in these files and remove the corresponding `fields.Integer(...)` line.
*   **Example (in `ReceiptSchema`):**
    *   **Before:** `fbo_location_id = fields.Integer(dump_only=True)`
    *   **After:** Line removed.

---

### **Phase 3: Frontend Refactoring**

Update the frontend to call the newly refactored backend endpoints and remove any FBO ID logic.

**Step 3.1: Update Frontend API Services** ✅ **COMPLETED**

Modify the TypeScript functions that call the backend API.

*   **File:** `frontend/app/services/auth-service.ts` ✅
    *   **Action:**
        1.  In the `EnhancedUser` interface, remove the `fbo_id: number | null` property.
        2.  Delete the `getCurrentUserFboId()` function entirely.

*   **File:** `frontend/app/services/receipt-service.ts` ✅
    *   **Action:**
        1.  In the `Receipt` interface, remove the `fbo_location_id` property.
        2.  Remove the import for `getCurrentUserFboId`.
        3.  Update the API call URLs to remove the FBO ID segment (e.g., `/fbo/${fboId}`).
        4.  Remove the `fboId` parameter from all function signatures.
    *   **Example (in `createDraftReceipt`):**
        *   **Before:**
            ```typescript
            export async function createDraftReceipt(fuel_order_id: number): Promise<ExtendedReceipt> {
              const fboId = getCurrentUserFboId();
              const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/fbo/${fboId}/receipts/draft`, ...);
              ...
            }
            ```
        *   **After:**
            ```typescript
            export async function createDraftReceipt(fuel_order_id: number): Promise<ExtendedReceipt> {
              const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/receipts/draft`, ...);
              ...
            }
            ```

*   **File:** `frontend/app/services/admin-fee-config-service.ts` ✅
    *   **Action:** Perform the same refactoring as in the previous step. Remove `fboId` from all function signatures and update the API URLs.

**Step 3.2: Update Frontend Components & Pages** ✅ **COMPLETED**

Remove the `fboId` prop and any related logic from all React components.

*   **Files to check:**
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fbo-config/fee-management/page.tsx` ✅ - Already correctly using global fee schedule
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fbo-config/fee-management/components/CopyAircraftFeesDialog.tsx` ✅
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fbo-config/fee-management/components/FeeRuleDialog.tsx` ✅
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fbo-config/fee-management/components/GeneralFeesTable.tsx` ✅
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fbo-config/fee-management/components/WaiverTiersTab.tsx` ✅
    *   `frontend/app/components/FeeScheduleTableRow.tsx` ✅
*   **Actions Completed:**
    1.  ✅ Removed the `fboId` prop from FeeScheduleTableRow interface and its usage within the component.
    2.  ✅ Updated component prop interfaces to match expected EditableFeeCell and EditableMinFuelCell interfaces.
    3.  ✅ Removed fboId from memoization comparison logic.

---

### **Phase 4: Final Cleanup & Verification**

The final phase is to ensure no stone was left unturned and that the application functions correctly.

*   **Step 4.1: Global Search** ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS**
    *   **Action:** Perform a case-insensitive global search across the entire repository for the terms `fbo_id`, `fboId`, `fbo_location_id`, and `FBOID`.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure no instances remain except in historical files like old migrations or documentation that is meant to be historical. Address any remaining active code.
    
    **⚠️ REMAINING ACTIVE CODE THAT NEEDS ATTENTION:**
    
    **Backend Services (Critical): ✅ COMPLETED**
    *   `backend/src/routes/auth_routes.py` ✅ - Removed `'fbo_id': user.fbo_location_id` from login responses
    *   `backend/src/services/admin_fee_config_service.py` ✅ - **COMPLETED** - Removed all FBO-related logic:
        - ✅ Removed fbo_location_id/fbo_id parameters from ALL method signatures
        - ✅ Removed ALL database query filters using FBO scoping
        - ✅ Updated waiver tier, fuel pricing, and fee override methods to operate globally
        - ✅ Simplified consolidated fee schedule to use global aircraft types
        - ✅ Removed deprecated FBO-specific methods entirely
    *   `backend/src/services/receipt_service.py` ✅ - **COMPLETED** - Removed all `fbo_location_id` references and logic:
        - ✅ `update_draft()` - removed fbo_location_id parameter and FBO filtering
        - ✅ `calculate_and_update_draft()` - removed fbo_location_id from signature and FeeCalculationContext 
        - ✅ `generate_receipt()` - removed fbo_location_id parameter and FBO filtering
        - ✅ `mark_as_paid()` - removed fbo_location_id parameter and FBO filtering
        - ✅ `get_receipts()` - removed fbo_location_id parameter and FBO filtering
        - ✅ `get_receipt_by_id()` - removed fbo_location_id parameter and FBO filtering
        - ✅ `_generate_receipt_number()` - converted from FBO-specific to global receipt numbering
        - ✅ `toggle_line_item_waiver()` - removed fbo_location_id parameter and FBO filtering
    *   `backend/src/services/fee_calculation_service.py` ✅ - **COMPLETED** - Removed all FBO-related logic:
        - ✅ Removed `fbo_location_id` from FeeCalculationContext dataclass
        - ✅ Removed FBO filtering from fee rules and waiver tiers queries
        - ✅ Updated all method signatures and database queries to operate globally
        - ✅ Fixed model imports and error message references
    
    **Frontend Components (Important):**

    *   `frontend/app/services/fee-service.ts` ✅ - Updated `getAvailableServices()` to not require fboId
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fbo-config/fuel-pricing/page.tsx` ✅ - Removed hardcoded `fboId = 1` references
    *   Various other components with TODO comments about removing fboId - Still remaining
    
    **Test Files (Lower Priority):**
    *   `cypress/fixtures/` - Multiple files with `fbo_location_id` in test data
    *   `cypress/support/` - Commands and type definitions with FBO parameters

*   **Step 4.2: Test the Application**
    *   **Action:** Run the application locally.
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Navigate to the Admin Fee Management page. It should load correctly without any FBO-related errors.
        2.  Create and edit fee rules, classifications, and waiver tiers.
        3.  Navigate to the CSR Receipts page. It should load correctly.
        4.  Create a draft receipt from a completed fuel order and verify it works.
        5.  Run any existing automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) to catch regressions.

This checklist provides a comprehensive, step-by-step plan. Follow it carefully to ensure a smooth and complete refactoring process.
