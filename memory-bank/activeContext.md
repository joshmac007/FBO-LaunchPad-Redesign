## Current Task: Authorization Enforcement Audit & Migration

**Issue:** Inconsistent authorization enforcement in FBO LaunchPad backend with potential for security bypass

**Key Problem:** The application has two authorization decorator systems:
- **Legacy:** `src/utils/decorators.py` with `@require_permission`  
- **Enhanced:** `src/utils/enhanced_auth_decorators.py` with new `PermissionService`

**Security Risk:** Routes using legacy decorators may not properly enforce the new granular permission model (direct, group, resource-specific permissions)

**Complexity Level:** Level 3 - Intermediate Feature

**Current Phase:** VAN mode analysis complete â†’ Transitioning to PLAN mode

**Critical Actions Required:**
1. Comprehensive route audit for decorator usage
2. Migration strategy from legacy to enhanced decorators
3. Integration testing for all permission scenarios
4. Security validation and verification

**Files of Interest:**
- `backend/src/utils/decorators.py` (legacy system)
- `backend/src/utils/enhanced_auth_decorators.py` (new system)
- All route files using authorization decorators
- Permission-related test files

**Security Implications:**
- Potential authorization bypass for granular permissions
- Inconsistent permission evaluation across the application
- Risk of privilege escalation for resource-specific permissions
