# Project Progress

This document tracks the overall progress of the FBO LaunchPad project.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Backend Foundation (Conceptual)
*   Project initialization and repository setup.
*   Core backend models and API endpoints defined (User, Auth, Aircraft, Customer, FuelOrder, FuelTruck, etc.).
*   Basic database schema design.

## Phase 2: Frontend API Integration - Initial Modules

Significant progress has been made in connecting the frontend to the backend API.

**Completed Integrations:**
*   **Core Systems:**
    *   Established Core API Communication (`api-config.ts`).
    *   Integrated Authentication (`auth-service.ts`, `login/page.tsx`) with backend `/auth/login`.
    *   Implemented live user permission fetching (`GET /auth/me/permissions`) via `PermissionContext`.
*   **Admin User Management:**
    *   `user-service.ts` refactored for admin CRUD operations (`/admin/users/` endpoints).
    *   `frontend/app/admin/users/page.tsx` fully integrated for API-based user management.
*   **Aircraft Management:**
    *   `aircraft-service.ts` refactored for admin CRUD (`/admin/aircraft/`) and general listing (`/aircraft/`).
    *   Implemented mapping for frontend/backend model discrepancies.
    *   `frontend/app/components/aircraft-lookup.tsx` updated to use the new service.
    *   Recommendation made for backend Aircraft model expansion.
*   **Admin Customer Management:**
    *   `customer-service.ts` created for admin CRUD operations (`/admin/customers/` endpoints).
    *   `frontend/app/admin/customers/page.tsx` created and fully integrated for API-based customer management.
*   **Admin Fuel Truck Management:**
    *   `fuel-truck-service.ts` created for CRUD operations (`/fuel-trucks/` endpoints).
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fuel-trucks/page.tsx` fully integrated for API-based fuel truck management.
*   **Testing & Cleanup:**
    *   Automated (Vitest) tests created for Customer and Fuel Truck admin pages.
    *   Code cleanup performed for integrated modules (removed mocks, console logs, unused code, and offline fallbacks).

**Next Steps:**
*   Thorough manual testing by QA/user.
*   Addressing items in `activeContext.md` (technical debt, backend needs).
*   Integration of any remaining modules or features (e.g., Fuel Orders).
*   Further UI/UX refinements based on integrated data.
*   Expansion of automated test coverage.
