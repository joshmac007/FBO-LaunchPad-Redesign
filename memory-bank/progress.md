# Project Progress

This document tracks the overall progress of the FBO LaunchPad project.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Backend Foundation (Conceptual)
*   Project initialization and repository setup.
*   Core backend models and API endpoints defined (User, Auth, Aircraft, Customer, FuelOrder, FuelTruck, etc.).
*   Basic database schema design.

## Phase 2: Frontend API Integration - Initial Modules

Significant progress has been made in connecting the frontend to the backend API.

**Completed Integrations:**
*   **Core Systems:**
    *   Established Core API Communication (`api-config.ts`).
    *   Integrated Authentication (`auth-service.ts`, `login/page.tsx`) with backend `/auth/login`.
    *   Implemented live user permission fetching (`GET /auth/me/permissions`) via `PermissionContext`.
*   **Admin User Management:**
    *   `user-service.ts` refactored for admin CRUD operations (`/admin/users/` endpoints).
    *   `frontend/app/admin/users/page.tsx` fully integrated for API-based user management.
*   **Aircraft Management:**
    *   `aircraft-service.ts` refactored for admin CRUD (`/admin/aircraft/`) and general listing (`/aircraft/`).
    *   Implemented mapping for frontend/backend model discrepancies.
    *   `frontend/app/components/aircraft-lookup.tsx` updated to use the new service.
    *   Recommendation made for backend Aircraft model expansion.
*   **Admin Customer Management:**
    *   `customer-service.ts` created for admin CRUD operations (`/admin/customers/` endpoints).
    *   `frontend/app/admin/customers/page.tsx` created and fully integrated for API-based customer management.
*   **Admin Fuel Truck Management:**
    *   `fuel-truck-service.ts` created for CRUD operations (`/fuel-trucks/` endpoints).
    *   `frontend/app/admin/fuel-trucks/page.tsx` fully integrated for API-based fuel truck management.
*   **Admin Permissions Management:**
    *   `permission-service.ts` completely refactored from localStorage mock to full API integration.
    *   `frontend/app/admin/permissions/page.tsx` updated for async API operations with proper loading states.
    *   Integrated with all 9 backend permission/role endpoints with JWT authentication.
*   **Testing & Cleanup:**
    *   Automated (Vitest) tests created for Customer and Fuel Truck admin pages.
    *   Code cleanup performed for integrated modules (removed mocks, console logs, unused code, and offline fallbacks).

**Next Steps:**
*   Thorough manual testing by QA/user.
*   Addressing items in `activeContext.md` (technical debt, backend needs).
*   Integration of any remaining modules or features (e.g., Fuel Orders).
*   Further UI/UX refinements based on integrated data.
*   Expansion of automated test coverage.

## Plan 4: Receipt Lifecycle Management & Calculation Integration (CSR - Backend Services & API)

*   **Objective:** Develop backend APIs and services for CSRs to manage the lifecycle of a receipt (draft creation, updates, fee calculation triggering, finalization, marking as paid) and to list/view receipts. This plan will integrate the `FeeCalculationService` from Plan 3.
*   **Relevant PRD Sections:** 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (API to trigger calculation), 4.4, 4.6 (APIs for list/view).
*   **General AI Agent Guidance for this Plan:**
    *   **Service Layer Responsibility:** The `ReceiptService` should handle all business logic related to `Receipt` and `ReceiptLineItem` state changes. It will be the primary consumer of the `FeeCalculationService`.
    *   **API Layer Responsibility:** The API routes should be thin, responsible for request validation, calling the service, and response formatting.
    *   **Database Operations:** All database changes should go through the service layer.
    *   **Testing:** Comprehensive testing is required for every endpoint and business logic scenario.

**Plan 4 is ready for production deployment and frontend integration.**

## Plan 5: CSR Frontend - Receipt Generation & Editing UI (`csr/receipts/new`, `csr/receipts/[id]/edit`)

*   **Objective:** Develop the frontend UI for CSRs to create new draft receipts from fuel orders, edit existing draft receipts, trigger fee calculations, view itemized fees/waivers, and finalize/generate receipts. This plan will consume the APIs built in Plan 4.
*   **Relevant PRD Sections:** 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 (UI aspects).
*   **General AI Agent Guidance for this Plan:**
    *   **Component-Based Architecture:** Break down the UI into smaller, manageable components (e.g., `ReceiptHeader`, `ReceiptTotals`, `ReceiptLineItemsList`, `AdditionalServicesForm`).
    *   **State Management:** This page will have complex state (the receipt object, line items, loading states for different actions, errors). A structured approach like a `useReducer` hook is highly recommended to manage the page's state logically.
    *   **Asynchronous Flow Control:** The UI must intelligently handle the asynchronous nature of the workflow. Buttons like "Generate Receipt" should be disabled until fees are successfully calculated. Loading indicators should be specific to the action being performed (e.g., a spinner on the "Calculate Fees" button).
    *   **Component Reusability:** Leverage existing components like `CustomerSelector` where possible.
